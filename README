Structure survey: loading testing for structures

Structure implementation:

• Mori.js List
• Lazy.js Sequence
• Immutable.js Sequence 
• Native structure - JS Array

Functions implementation:

• Ramda 
• Lodash
• Native JS
• C++ addons

Requirements: node-gyp

Configuration:

  DELIMITER=<>              • Start of each string 

  STRUCT_MAX=1000           • Maximum structure size
  STRUCT_STEP=100           • Structure step decrement

  ITER_MAX=10               • Maximum iteration value
  ITER_STEP=1               • Structure iteration decrement

  N_LIST_DATA_DIR           • Generated data directory 

! Do not use meaningless values: there is no time to implement constraints.

Extention:

! To extend the survey make sure the order of an occurrence of the structure 
libraries in 'makeNumListSuiteMatrixList' function is the same as in 
STRUCTURE_LIBRARIES list. The source is the following:
'~/source/struct-master/bench-suite/suite.generator.handler.js'.
The order is determined by the order of calling of the 'add' function.
